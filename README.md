# Credit_Risk_Assesment
 
From the dataset We are trying to create a model that can determine whether a customer will default or not. So that it can minimize risk for lenders and customers.
We achieve this by doing Data cleaning, simple EDA and Modeling using PyCaret library to create the Machine Learning model.

An 93,83% accuracy level was achieved in predicting the loan defaults on 32,576 loans and 12 benchmarks. With this model, the default rate would decrease by 15,83%, resulting in minimized risk for both the lender and applicant.
